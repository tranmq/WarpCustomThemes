# Warp Custom Themes
I just learned about [warp terminal](https://www.warp.dev/) a month ago at the beginning of May, 2022 and really enjoy using it.  I started playing around with custom themes and creating a bunch basing on the [bundled](https://github.com/warpdotdev/themes/tree/main/warp_bundled) and the [standard](https://github.com/warpdotdev/themes/tree/main/standard) themes.  These are the ones that I like and want to keep.


# Install
* Clone this repo or download the zip file of source code.
* Create the `~/.warp/themes/` folder if it does not exist yet. (`mkdir -p ~/.warp/themes/`)
* Copy all files from the `themes` folder of the cloned `git` repository or the extracted Zip file to the`~/.warp/themes/` folder.
* From [warp](https://www.warp.dev/), open the theme picker and select a custom theme.  Enjoy!
